1) what is sourceDescriptor?
    . any vocabularies (like MeSH or MedDRA) organize their content in layers.
    . A descriptor is like the main heading or category that groups together related terms (atoms) and synonyms.
    . Think of it as the "folder name" under which several terms (the actual strings) live.
    . Example (MeSH)
        Descriptor (main heading): D012140 → Tuberculosis
            Under this descriptor, you’ll find:
            "TB"
            "Tuberculoses"
            "Koch's Disease"
            etc.
    . All those terms are linked atoms, but the descriptor is the central ID for the concept in that vocabulary.


2) what is SourceConcept?
    . A concept identifier in some source vocabularies.
    . Some vocabularies (like SNOMED CT) don’t use descriptors—they use concepts instead.
    . A concept is a meaning unit (like Myocardial Infarction), which may have different codes or term types.
    . Example (SNOMED CT):
    . Concept ID: 22298006 → Myocardial Infarction
    . Linked terms: “Heart Attack”, “MI”, “Myocardial Infarction”
    . 👉 SourceConcept = the source’s own concept-level ID.
