# Relation Extraction in Clinical Documents using LLaMA and RAG

## Overview
This repository explores relation extraction in clinical documents leveraging **LLaMA** (Large Language Model Meta AI) and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. Our goal is to enhance clinical NLP by accurately identifying relationships between medical entities within unstructured text.

## Features
- Utilizes **LLaMA**, a state-of-the-art language model for understanding clinical text.
- Implements **RAG** to enhance contextual understanding and knowledge retrieval.
- Fine-tuned on clinical datasets to improve relation extraction accuracy.
- Supports entity recognition and relation classification between medical concepts.

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sfarzi/Relation_extraction_RAG.git
```

## Dataset
[BioCreative-V-CDR-Corpus](https://github.com/JHnlp/BioCreative-V-CDR-Corpus)

## Model Architecture
- **LLaMA-70B** processes clinical text and generates embeddings. 
- **RAG** retrieves relevant knowledge to improve contextual accuracy.
- A **relation classifier** predicts relationships between extracted entities.

## Evaluation
The model is evaluated using:
- **Precision, Recall, and F1-score** for relation extraction.
