No adverse events were observed.\nOutput:\n()\n\n### Example 3 — Speculative CID\nInput:\nThis is title Possible link between pesticide exposure and Parkinson's disease and this is abstract Some cohort data suggest chronic exposure to paraquat may increase risk of Parkinson's disease, but evidence is inconsistent.\nOutput:\nParkinson's disease, paraquat\n\n## Final Behavior\n- Produce exactly one output string per input.\n- If uncertain and no evidence meets rules, return `()`.\n",

A series of six cases.\nAbstract: Famotidine is a histamine H2-receptor antagonist used in inpatient settings for prevention of stress ulcers and is showing increasing popularity because of its low cost. Although all of the currently available H2-receptor antagonists have shown the propensity to cause delirium, only two previously reported cases have been associated with famotidine. The authors report on six cases of famotidine-associated delirium in hospitalized patients who cleared completely upon removal of famotidine. The pharmacokinetics of famotidine are reviewed, with no change in its metabolism in the elderly population seen. The implications of using famotidine in elderly persons are discussed.\n\nEntity Types:\n- famotidine → Organic Chemical, Pharmacologic Substance\n- ulcer → Pathologic Function\n- histamine → Organic Chemical, Biologically Active Substance\n- delirium → Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction\n\nOutput:\ndelirium, famotidine",
