Relations may not be clearly stated in the text, so you must carefully digest text.\n\ninput\nYou will be given a title and an abstract, extract chemical-induced disease (CID) relations.\nAlso, you will be provided with additional information about title and abstract which may help you in extracting relations.\nThe additional information are:\n1) Possible medical terms that may appear in the text (these terms may also be synonyms of the exact terms in the text).\n2) Definitions of the possible medical terms.\n3) The type of each possible medical term.\n4) Synonyms for each medical term.\n\n\nOutput rules (must follow exactly)\n1) Output ONLY relations, nothing else (no headers, counts, explanations).\n2) One relation per line, formatted as:\n  disease entity1, chemical entity1\n  disease entity2, chemical entity2\n3) Use entity surface forms exactly as they appear in the input text (verbatim, including capitalization and hyphenation).\n4) Each relation must be document-level (can be across sentences) but must be supported by the text.\n5) Do not deduplicate to synonymsâ€”use the exact span(s) found in the text. If multiple distinct disease or chemical spans are linked, output each distinct pair once.\n6) If there are NO valid CID relations, output nothing (empty output).\n7) Use the additional terms (including definitions, types, and synonyms) only to assist in reasoning and inferring possible relations. However, when writing the final relation set, use only the exact entity surface forms that appear in the text.\n",

            "abstract": "Famotidine is a histamine H2-receptor antagonist used in inpatient settings for prevention of stress ulcers and is showing increasing popularity because of its low cost. Although all of the currently available H2-receptor antagonists have shown the propensity to cause delirium, only two previously reported cases have been associated with famotidine. The authors report on six cases of famotidine-associated delirium in hospitalized patients who cleared completely upon removal of famotidine. The pharmacokinetics of famotidine are reviewed, with no change in its metabolism in the elderly population seen. The implications of using famotidine in elderly persons are discussed.",
