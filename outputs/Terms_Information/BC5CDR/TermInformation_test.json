        "definition": "<h3>What is delirium?</h3> <p>Delirium is a mental state in which you are confused, disoriented, and not able to think or remember clearly. It usually starts suddenly. It is often temporary and treatable.</p> <p>There are three types of delirium:</p><ul> <li>Hypoactive, when you are not active and seem sleepy, tired, or depressed</li> <li>Hyperactive, when you are restless or agitated</li> <li>Mixed, when you change back and forth between being hypoactive and hyperactive</li> </ul> <h3>What causes delirium?</h3> <p>There are many different problems that can cause delirium. Some of the more common causes include:</p><ul> <li><strong>Advanced <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/cancer.html\">cancer</a>.</strong></li> <li><strong>Alcohol or <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/druguseandaddiction.html\">drugs</a></strong>, either from intoxication or withdrawal. This includes a serious type of alcohol withdrawal syndrome called delirium tremens. It usually happens to people who stop drinking after years of <a href=\"alcoholusedisorderaud.html\" tid=\"120\">alcohol use disorder (AUD)</a>.</li> <li><strong><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/dehydration.html\">Dehydration</a> and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/fluidandelectrolytebalance.html\">electrolyte imbalances</a>.</strong></li> <li><strong><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/dementia.html\">Dementia</a>.</strong></li> <li><strong>Hospitalization</strong>, especially in intensive care.</li> <li><strong>Infections</strong>, such as <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/urinarytractinfections.html\">urinary tract infections</a>, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/pneumonia.html\">pneumonia</a>, and the <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/flu.html\">flu</a>.</li> <li><strong>Medicines.</strong> This could be a <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/drugreactions.html\">side effect</a> of a medicine, such as sedatives or <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/opioidsandopioidusedisorderoud.html\">opioids</a>.

They often come and go. The most common symptoms include:</p><ul> <li>Changes in alertness (usually more alert in the morning, less at night)</li> <li>Changing levels of consciousness</li> <li>Confusion</li> <li>Disorganized thinking, talking in a way that doesn't make sense</li> <li>Disrupted sleep patterns, sleepiness</li> <li>Emotional changes: anger, agitation, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/depression.html\">depression</a>, irritability, overexcitement</li> <li>Hallucinations and delusions</li> <li>Memory problems, especially with short-term memory</li> <li>Trouble concentrating</li> </ul> <h3>How is delirium diagnosed?</h3> <p>Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:</p><ul> <li>A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms</li> <li>Physical and neurological exams</li> <li>Mental status testing, which checks for problems with your thinking and alertness </li> <li>Lab and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/diagnosticimaging.html\">diagnostic imaging</a> tests</li> </ul> <p>Delirium and dementia have similar symptoms, so it can be hard to tell them apart. You can also have both at the same time. The differences between them are that:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Delirium</strong> starts suddenly and can cause hallucinations. It is mainly a problem with attention and staying alert. The symptoms may get better or worse and can last for hours or weeks.</li> <li><strong>Dementia</strong> develops slowly and does not cause hallucinations. It usually starts with memory loss. The symptoms don't change often, like they can with delirium. Dementia almost never gets better.</li> </ul> <h3>What are the treatments for delirium?</h3> <p>Treatment of delirium focuses on the causes and symptoms of delirium. The first step is to identify the cause. Often, treating the cause will lead to a full recovery. The recovery may take some time - weeks or sometimes even months. In the meantime, there may be treatments to manage the symptoms, such as:</p><ul> <li>Controlling the environment, which includes making sure that the room is quiet and well-lit, having clocks or calendars in view, and having family members around</li> <li>Medicines, including those that control aggression or agitation and pain relievers if there is pain</li> <li>If needed, making sure that the person has a hearing aid, glasses, or other devices for communication</li> </ul> <h3>Can delirium be prevented?</h3> <p>Treating the conditions that can cause delirium may reduce the risk of getting it. Hospitals can help lower the risk of delirium by avoiding sedatives and making sure that hospital rooms are kept quiet, calm, and well-lit. It can also help to have family members around and to have the same staff members treat the person each day (if possible).</p>",

As a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), indomethacin inhibits the enzyme cyclooxygenase, thereby preventing cyclooxygenase-mediated DNA adduct formation by heterocyclic aromatic amines. This agent also may inhibit the expression of multidrug-resistant protein type 1, resulting in increased efficacies of some antineoplastic agents in treating multi-drug resistant tumors. In addition, indomethacin activates phosphatases that inhibit the migration and proliferation of cancer cells and downregulates survivin, which may result in tumor cell apoptosis.

Exposure to chemicals in the environment might play a role.</p> <p>Symptoms begin gradually, often on one side of the body. Later they affect both sides. They include:</p><ul> <li>Trembling of hands, arms, legs, jaw and face </li> <li>Stiffness of the arms, legs and trunk </li> <li>Slowness of movement </li> <li>Poor balance and coordination </li> </ul> <p>As symptoms get worse, people with the disease may have trouble walking, talking, or doing simple tasks. They may also have problems such as depression, sleep problems, or trouble chewing, swallowing, or speaking.</p> <p>There is no specific test for PD, so it can be difficult to diagnose. Doctors use a medical history and a neurological examination to diagnose it.</p> <p>PD usually begins around age 60, but it can start earlier. It is more common in men than in women. There is no cure for PD. A variety of medicines sometimes help symptoms dramatically. Surgery and deep brain stimulation (DBS) can help severe cases. With DBS, electrodes are surgically implanted in the brain. They send electrical pulses to stimulate the parts of the brain that control movement.</p> <p class=\"\">NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</p>",

Levodopa is a prodrug that is converted to dopamine by DOPA decarboxylase and can cross the blood-brain barrier. When in the brain, levodopa is decarboxylated to dopamine and stimulates the dopaminergic receptors, thereby compensating for the depleted supply of endogenous dopamine seen in Parkinson's disease. To assure that adequate concentrations of levodopa reach the central nervous system, it is administered with carbidopa, a decarboxylase inhibitor that does not cross the blood-brain barrier, thereby diminishing the decarboxylation and inactivation of levodopa in peripheral tissues and increasing the delivery of dopamine to the CNS.

Specifically, the agent inhibits nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB, a protein that is constitutively activated in some cancers, thereby interfering with NF-kappaB-mediated cell survival, tumor growth, and angiogenesis. In vivo, bortezomib delays tumor growth and enhances the cytotoxic effects of radiation and chemotherapy.",

        "definition": "<h3>What is personality?</h3> <p>Your personality is your own way of thinking, feeling, behaving, and relating to others. Once you become an adult, your personality usually doesn't change much.</p> <h3>What are personality disorders?</h3> <p>Personality disorders are a group of <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/mentaldisorders.html\">mental disorders</a>. They involve long-term patterns of thoughts and behaviors that are different from what is considered normal in your culture. The thoughts and behaviors are unhealthy and inflexible. They cause serious problems with relationships, work, and social activities. They can make it hard to deal with everyday stresses and problems.</p> <h3>What are the types of personality disorders?</h3> <p>There are 10 types of personality disorders. They are grouped into three different categories called clusters. The types in each cluster have some similar symptoms and characteristics. The clusters and types are:</p> <p><strong>Cluster A</strong> personality disorders involve unusual and odd thoughts and behaviors. It includes:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Paranoid personality disorder,</strong> in which a person has paranoia (an extreme fear and distrust of others). They may think that someone is trying to harm them.</li> <li><strong>Schizoid personality disorder,</strong> in which a person prefers to be alone and is not interested in having relationships with others.</li> <li><strong>Schizotypal personality disorder,</strong> in which a person has unusual thoughts and ways of behaving and speaking. They are uncomfortable having close relationships with others.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Cluster B</strong> personality disorders involve dramatic and emotional thoughts and behaviors that can keep changing. It includes:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Antisocial personality disorder,</strong> in which a person has a long-term pattern of manipulating, exploiting, or violating the rights of others.</li> <li><strong>Borderline personality disorder,</strong> in which a person has lots of trouble managing their emotions. This makes them impulsive and uncertain about how they see themselves. It can cause a lot of trouble in their relationships.</li> <li><strong>Histrionic personality disorder,</strong> in which a person is dramatic, has strong emotions, and always wants attention from others.</li> <li><strong>Narcissistic personality disorder,</strong> in which a person lacks empathy and wants to be admired by others. They think that they are better than others and that they deserve special treatment.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Cluster C</strong> personality disorders involve anxious and fearful thoughts and behaviors. It includes:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Avoidant personality disorder,</strong> in which a person is very shy and feels that they are not as good as others. They often avoid people because they fear rejection.</li> <li><strong>Dependent personality disorder,</strong> in which a person depends too much on others and feels that they need to be taken care of. They may let others treat them badly because they are afraid of losing the relationship.</li> <li><strong>Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder,</strong> in which a person needs control and order. They are perfectionists and can be inflexible. Although some of the symptoms are similar, this is not the same thing as <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/obsessivecompulsivedisorder.html\">obsessive-compulsive disorder</a> (OCD).</li> </ul> <h3>What causes personality disorders?</h3> <p>Personality disorders usually begin when someone is in their teens or early adult years. The cause is unknown. However, genes and childhood experiences such as <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/childabuse.html\">abuse</a> and trauma likely play a role.</p> <h3>What are the symptoms of personality disorders?</h3> <p>The symptoms of each personality disorder are different. But each disorder involves problems and uncertainty with how people see themselves. The disorders also cause problems in relationships with other people.</p> <p>People with personality disorders may have trouble realizing that they have a problem. To them, their thoughts are normal. They may see others as the problem. So they may not seek help when they need it. Or, if they seek help, it may be because of another reason. They may be looking for help because of other mental health symptoms or problems with relationships and work. Sometimes someone else, such as a family member or social agency, may ask them to get help.</p> <h3>How are personality disorders diagnosed?</h3> <p>A mental health care provider can diagnose personality disorders. A mental health provider is a health care professional who specializes in diagnosing and treating mental health problems. To make a diagnosis, the provider will consider the person's symptoms, experiences, and family medical history. A thorough medical exam may also be done to help rule out other possible causes of the symptoms.</p> <h3>How are personality disorders treated?</h3> <p>Talk therapy, also known as psychotherapy, is the main treatment for personality disorders. Medicines may help relieve certain symptoms, such as <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/anxiety.html\">anxiety</a> or mood swings.</p>",

When people think of seizures, they often think of convulsions in which a person's body shakes rapidly and uncontrollably. Not all seizures cause convulsions. There are many types of seizures and some have mild symptoms. Seizures fall into two main groups. Focal seizures, also called partial seizures, happen in just one part of the brain. Generalized seizures are a result of abnormal activity on both sides of the brain. </p> <p>Most seizures last from 30 seconds to 2 minutes and do not cause lasting harm. However, it is a medical emergency if seizures last longer than 5 minutes or if a person has many seizures and does not wake up between them. Seizures can have many causes, including medicines, high fevers, head injuries and certain diseases.

One thousand-fold more potent than its parent compound irinotecan, SN-38 inhibits topoisomerase I activity by stabilizing the cleavable complex between topoisomerase I and DNA, resulting in DNA breaks that inhibit DNA replication and trigger apoptotic cell death. Because ongoing DNA synthesis is necessary for irinotecan to exert its cytotoxic effects, it is classified as an S-phase-specific agent.",

Doxorubicin, isolated from the bacterium Streptomyces peucetius var. caesius, is the hydroxylated congener of daunorubicin. Doxorubicin intercalates between base pairs in the DNA helix, thereby preventing DNA replication and ultimately inhibiting protein synthesis. Additionally, doxorubicin inhibits topoisomerase II which results in an increased and stabilized cleavable enzyme-DNA linked complex during DNA replication and subsequently prevents the ligation of the nucleotide strand after double-strand breakage. Doxorubicin also forms oxygen free radicals resulting in cytotoxicity secondary to lipid peroxidation of cell membrane lipids; the formation of oxygen free radicals also contributes to the toxicity of the anthracycline antibiotics, namely the cardiac and cutaneous vascular effects.",

This agent lowers plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein levels, and modulates immune responses through the suppression of MHC II (major histocompatibility complex II) on interferon gamma-stimulated antigen-presenting cells such as human vascular endothelial cells. Due to its anti-inflammatory effects mediated by alterations of lipid metabolism, fluvastatin may possess chemopreventive and therapeutic antineoplastic properties.",

Once the patient is in a horizontal position, blood flow to the brain is no longer hindered by gravitation and consciousness is regained. Unconsciousness usually lasts for seconds to minutes. Headache and drowsiness (which usually follow seizures) do not follow a syncopal attack. Syncope results from a sudden impairment of brain metabolism usually due to a reduction in cerebral blood flow. [https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0736-9199, PMID:29255499]",

It usually happens when the fluid pressure inside the eyes slowly rises, damaging the optic nerve. Often there are no symptoms at first. Without treatment, people with glaucoma will slowly lose their peripheral, or side vision. They seem to be looking through a tunnel. Over time, straight-ahead vision may decrease until no vision remains.</p> <p>A comprehensive eye exam can tell if you have glaucoma. People at risk should get eye exams at least every two years.

        "definition": "A phenolic phytochemical naturally occurring in extra virgin olive oil, with potential antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and cancer preventive activities. Although the mechanisms of action through which hydroxytyrosol exerts its effects have yet to be fully determined, this agent affects the expression of various components of the inflammatory response, possibly through the modulation of the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) pathway. The effects include the modulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as the inhibition of interleukin-1alpha (IL-1a), IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-12, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a); increased secretion of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10; inhibition of the production of certain chemokines, such as C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10/IP-10), C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2/MCP-1), and macrophage inflammatory protein-1beta (CCL4/MIP-1b); and inhibition of the expression of the enzymes inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS/NOS2) and prostaglandin E2 synthase (PGES), which prevent the production of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E (PGE2), respectively. In addition, hydroxytyrosol is able to regulate the expression of other genes involved in the regulation of tumor cell proliferation, such as extracellular signal-regulated and cyclin-dependent kinases. Also, hydroxytyrosol scavenges free radicals and prevents oxidative DNA damage. This induces apoptosis and inhibits proliferation in susceptible cancer cells.

The unused oxygen and fuel molecules build up in the cells and cause damage.</p> <p>The symptoms of mitochondrial disease can vary. It depends on how many mitochondria are defective, and where they are in the body. Sometimes only one organ, tissue, or cell type is affected. But often the problem affects many of them. Muscle and nerve cells have especially high energy needs, so muscular and neurological problems are common. The diseases range from mild to severe. Some types can be fatal.</p> <p>Genetic mutations cause these diseases. They usually happen before age 20, and some are more common in infants.

        "definition": "<h3>What is a pulmonary embolism (PE)?</h3> <p>A pulmonary embolism (PE) is a sudden blockage in a lung artery. It usually happens when a <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/bloodclots.html\">blood clot</a> breaks loose and travels through the bloodstream to the lungs. PE is a serious condition that can cause:</p><ul> <li>Permanent damage to the lungs</li> <li>Low oxygen levels in your blood</li> <li>Damage to other organs in your body from not getting enough oxygen</li> </ul> <p>PE can be life-threatening, especially if a clot is large, or if there are many clots.</p> <h3>What causes a pulmonary embolism (PE)?</h3> <p>The cause is usually a blood clot that breaks loose and travels through the bloodstream to the lungs. The clot is usually a <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/deepveinthrombosis.html\">deep vein thrombosis</a> (DVT), a clot in the leg. In rare cases, material such as air bubbles, clumps of fat, or parts of a tumor can block the lung artery and cause PE.</p> <h3>Who is more likely to develop a pulmonary embolism (PE)?</h3> <p>Anyone can get a pulmonary embolism (PE), but certain things can raise your risk of PE:</p><ul> <li><strong>Having surgery,</strong> especially joint replacement surgery.</li> <li><strong>Certain medical conditions,</strong> including</li> <ul> <li>Cancers</li> <li>Heart diseases</li> <li>Lung diseases</li> <li>A broken hip or leg bone or other trauma</li> </ul> <li><strong>Hormone-based medicines,</strong> such as <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/birthcontrol.html\">birth control pills</a> or <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/hormonereplacementtherapy.html\">hormone replacement therapy</a>.</li> <li><strong>Pregnancy and childbirth.</strong> The risk is highest for about six weeks after childbirth.</li> <li><strong>Not moving for long periods,</strong> such as being on bed rest, having a cast, or taking a long plane flight. </li><li><strong>Age.</strong> Your risk increases as you get older, especially after age 40. </li><li><strong>Family history and genetics.</strong> Certain genetic changes that can increase your risk of blood clots and PE. </li><li><strong>Obesity</strong>.</li> </ul> <h3>What are the symptoms of a pulmonary embolism (PE)?</h3> <p>Symptoms of PE include:</p> <ul> <li>Shortness of breath</li> <li>Rapid breathing</li> <li>Chest pain or discomfort, which usually gets worse when you cough or take a deep breath</li> <li>Increased heart rate</li> <li>Coughing up blood</li> <li>Very low blood pressure, lightheadedness, or fainting</li> </ul> <p>Sometimes people with PE don't have any symptoms until they have serious complications, such as <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/pulmonaryhypertension.html\">pulmonary hypertension</a> (high blood pressure in the arteries to your lungs). </p> <h3>How is a pulmonary embolism (PE) diagnosed?</h3> <p>It can be difficult to diagnose PE. To find out if you have a PE, your health care provider will:</p><ul> <li>Take your medical history, including asking about your symptoms and risk factors for PE</li> <li>Do a physical exam</li> <li>Likely order some tests, including various<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/diagnosticimaging.html\"> imaging</a> and blood tests</li> </ul> <h3>What are the treatments for a pulmonary embolism (PE)?</h3> <p>If you have PE, you need medical treatment right away. The goal of treatment is to break up clots and help keep other clots from forming. Treatment options include medicines and procedures.</p> <p><strong>Medicines</strong>:</p><ul> <li><strong>Anticoagulants,</strong> or <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/bloodthinners.html\">blood thinners</a>, keep blood clots from getting larger and stop new clots from forming. You might get them as an injection, a pill, or through an I.V. (intravenous). They can cause bleeding, especially if you are taking other medicines that also thin your blood, such as aspirin.</li> <li><strong>Thrombolytics</strong> are medicines to dissolve blood clots. You may get them if you have large clots that cause severe symptoms or other serious complications. Thrombolytics can cause sudden bleeding, so they are used if your PE is serious and may be life-threatening.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Procedures</strong>:</p><ul> <li><strong>Catheter-assisted thrombus removal</strong> uses a flexible tube to reach a blood clot in your lung. Your health care provider can insert a tool in the tube to break up the clot or to deliver medicine through the tube. Usually you will get medicine to put you to sleep for this procedure.</li> <li><strong>A vena cava filter</strong> may be used in some people who cannot take blood thinners. Your health care provider inserts a filter inside a large vein called the vena cava. The filter catches blood clots before they travel to the lungs, which prevents pulmonary embolism. But the filter does not stop new blood clots from forming.</li> </ul> <h3>Can pulmonary embolism (PE) be prevented?</h3> <p>Preventing new blood clots can prevent PE. Prevention may include:</p><ul> <li>Continuing to take blood thinners. It's also important to get regular checkups with your provider, to make sure that the dosage of your medicines is working to prevent blood clots but not causing bleeding.</li> <li>Heart-healthy lifestyle changes, such as heart-healthy eating, exercise, and, if you smoke, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/quittingsmoking.html\">quitting smoking</a>. </li>Using compression stockings to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT). <li>Moving your legs when sitting for long periods of time (such as on long trips).</li> <li>Moving around as soon as possible after surgery or being confined to a bed.</li> </ul> <p class=\"\">NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</p>",

They can cause problems with:</p><ul> <li>Understanding what people are saying</li> <li>Speaking</li> <li>Reading</li> <li>Writing</li> <li>Doing math</li> <li>Paying attention</li> </ul> <p>Often, children have more than one kind of learning disability. They may also have another condition, such as <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/attentiondeficithyperactivitydisorder.html\">attention deficit hyperactivity disorder</a> (ADHD), which can make learning even more of a challenge.</p> <h3>What causes learning disabilities?</h3> <p>Learning disabilities don't have anything to do with intelligence. They are caused by differences in the brain, and they affect the way the brain processes information. These differences are usually present at birth. But there are certain factors that can play a role in the development of a learning disability, including:</p><ul> <li>Genetics</li> <li>Environmental exposures (such as <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/leadpoisoning.html\">lead</a>)</li> <li>Problems during pregnancy (such as the <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/pregnancyandsubstanceuse.html\">mother's drug use</a>)</li> </ul> <h3>How do I know if my child has a learning disability?</h3> <p>The earlier you can find and treat a learning disability, the better. Unfortunately, learning disabilities are usually not recognized until a child is in school. If you notice that your child is struggling, talk to your child's teacher or health care provider about an evaluation for a learning disability. The evaluation may include a medical exam, a discussion of family history, and intellectual and school performance testing.</p> <h3>What are the treatments for learning disabilities?</h3> <p>The most common treatment for learning disabilities is special education. A teacher or other learning specialist can help your child learn skills by building on strengths and finding ways to make up for weaknesses. Educators may try special teaching methods, make changes to the classroom, or use technologies that can assist your child's learning needs. Some children also get help from tutors or speech or language therapists.</p> <p>A child with a learning disability may struggle with low self-esteem, frustration, and other problems. Mental health professionals can help your child understand these feelings, develop coping tools, and build healthy relationships.</p> <p>If your child has another condition such as ADHD, he or she will need treatment for that condition as well.</p> <p class=\"\">NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</p>",

In addition, tobramycin induces misreading of the mRNA template causing incorrect amino acids to be incorporated into the growing polypeptide chain, consequently interfering with protein elongation.",

The PEG moiety lowers the clearance of interferon alpha-2b, thereby extending the duration of its therapeutic effects, but may also reduce the interferon-mediated stimulation of an immune response.

Additionally, in vitro studies demonstrate that this agent induces DNA breakage in a dose-dependent manner. Artesunate has also been shown to stimulate cell differentiation, arrest the cell cycle in the G1 and G2/M phases, inhibit cell proliferation, and induce apoptosis through mitochondrial and caspase signaling pathways.

Most cases are seen in patients over the age of 50 years, but this tumor can also occur in younger individuals and even in children. Hepatocellular carcinoma is more common in males than females and is associated with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, chronic alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. Serum elevation of alpha-fetoprotein occurs in a large percentage of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Grossly, hepatocellular carcinoma may present as a single mass, as multiple nodules, or as diffuse liver involvement. Microscopically, there is a wide range of differentiation from tumor to tumor (well differentiated to poorly differentiated tumors). Hepatocellular carcinomas quickly metastasize to regional lymph nodes and lung. The overall median survival of untreated liver cell carcinoma is about 4 months. The most effective treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma is complete resection of the tumor. Lately, an increasing number of tumors have been treated with liver transplantation.",

        "definition": "A cyclic organic compound possessing two nitrogen atoms in opposite positions within a 6-member heterocyclic ring that serves as a backbone for piperazine derivatives and acts as a gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) receptor agonist in nematodes, with potential anti-helminthic activity. Upon administration, piperazine binds to the GABA inhibitory receptors in susceptible nematodes, thereby inducing chloride channel opening and hyperpolarization. This results in paralysis of the worm musculature and allows normal peristalsis to dislodge the worm from the intestinal lumen, which causes the worm to be expelled from the body. Unlike vertebrates where GABA is restricted to the central nervous system (CNS), the GABA receptors in helminths are also expressed in the peripheral nervous system.",

        "definition": "<h3>What is heroin?</h3> <p>Heroin is an illegal, very addictive <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/opioidsandopioidusedisorderoud.html\">opioid drug</a>. It's made from morphine, which comes from the seedpod of opium poppy plants. These plants grow in Southeast and Southwest Asia, Mexico, and Colombia. Heroin can be a white or brown powder, or a black sticky substance known as black tar heroin.</p> <h3>How do people use heroin?</h3> <p>People inject, sniff, snort, or smoke heroin. Some people mix heroin with crack <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/cocaine.html\">cocaine</a>, which is called \"speedballing.\" All these ways of taking heroin send it to the brain very quickly, which makes it highly addictive.</p> <h3>What are the short-term effects of heroin?</h3> <p>People who use heroin report feeling a \"rush\" (a surge of pleasure). And then they may feel other effects, such as a warm flushing of the skin, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/drymouth.html\">dry mouth</a>, and a heavy feeling in the arms and legs. They may also have severe <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/itching.html\">itching</a>, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/nauseaandvomiting.html\">nausea, and vomiting</a>. After these first effects, they will usually be drowsy for several hours, and their breathing will slow down.</p> <h3>What are the long-term effects of heroin?</h3> <p>People who use heroin over the long term may develop many different health problems. These problems could include <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/liverdiseases.html\">liver</a>, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/kidneydiseases.html\">kidney</a>, and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/lungdiseases.html\">lung</a> disease, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/mentaldisorders.html\">mental disorders</a>, and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/abscess.html\">abscesses</a>.</p> <p>People who inject the drug also risk getting infectious diseases such as <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/hiv.html\">HIV</a>, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/hepatitis.html\">hepatitis</a>, and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/bacterialinfections.html\">bacterial infections</a> of the skin, bloodstream, and heart (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/endocarditis.html\">endocarditis</a>). They can also get collapsed veins. When a vein collapses, the blood cannot flow through it.</p> <p>Repeated use of heroin can lead to tolerance. This means users need more and more of the drug to have the same effect. At higher doses over time, the body becomes dependent on heroin. If someone who is dependent on heroin stops using it, they have withdrawal symptoms. These symptoms can include restlessness, muscle and bone pain, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/diarrhea.html\">diarrhea</a>, vomiting, and cold flashes with goose bumps.</p> <p>Repeated use of heroin often leads to heroin use disorder, sometimes called addiction. This is more than physical dependence. It's a chronic (long-lasting) brain disorder. When someone has it, they continue to use heroin even though it causes problems in their life. Some examples include health problems and not being able to meet responsibilities at work, school, or home. Getting and using heroin becomes their main purpose in life.</p> <h3>Can a person overdose on heroin?</h3> <p>It's possible to <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/opioidoverdose.html\">overdose</a> on heroin. This happens when a person uses so much heroin that it causes a life-threatening reaction or death. All heroin users are at risk of an overdose because they never know the actual strength of the drug they are taking or what may have been added to it. And people often use heroin along with other drugs or alcohol. This can increase the risk of an overdose.</p> <p>When people overdose on heroin, their heart rate and breathing slow down. Their breathing may slow do so much that not enough oxygen reaches the brain. This condition is called hypoxia. Hypoxia can lead to a <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/coma.html\">coma</a>, permanent brain damage, or death.</p> <h3>How can a heroin overdose be treated?</h3> <p>A medicine called naloxone can treat a heroin (or other opioid) overdose if it is given in time. It works by blocking the effects of the opioid on the body. Sometimes more than one dose of the medicine is needed.</p> <p>There are two forms of naloxone that anyone can use without medical training: nasal spray and injectable. People at risk of an overdose are encouraged to carry naloxone with them. They can buy naloxone at a pharmacy.</p> <h3>What are the treatments for heroin use disorder?</h3> <p>Treatments for heroin use disorder include medicines to treat withdrawal symptoms, medicine to block the effects of opioids, and behavioral treatments. Often, a combination of medicine and behavioral treatment works best. People getting treatment for heroin use disorder should work with their health care providers to come up with a treatment plan that fits their needs.</p> <p class=\"\">NIH: National Institute on Drug Abuse</p>",

Clonidine binds to and stimulates central alpha-2 adrenergic receptors, thereby reducing the amount of norepinephrine (NE) release and thus decreasing sympathetic outflow to the heart, kidneys, and peripheral vasculature. The reduction in sympathetic outflow leads to decreased peripheral vascular resistance, decreased blood pressure, and decreased heart rate. In addition, clonidine binds to imidazoline receptor subtype 1 (I1), which may also contribute to a reduction in blood pressure.",

        "definition": "<h3>What is blood glucose?</h3> <p><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/bloodglucose.html\">Blood glucose</a>, or blood sugar, is the main sugar found in your blood. It is your body's primary source of energy. It comes from the food you eat. Your body breaks down most of that food into glucose and releases it into your bloodstream. When your blood glucose goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to be used for energy.</p> <p>For people with <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/diabetes.html\">diabetes</a>, your body doesn't make enough insulin, can't use it as well as it should, or both. Too much glucose stays in your blood and doesn't reach your cells.</p> <h3>What is hypoglycemia?</h3> <p>Hypoglycemia means low glucose. It happens when the level of glucose in your blood drops below what is healthy for you:</p> <ul> <li>For many people with diabetes, this means a blood glucose level lower than 70 mg/dL. Your number might be different, so check with your health care team to find out what blood glucose level is too low for you.</li> <li>For people who don't have diabetes, hypoglycemia is typically a blood glucose level lower than 55 mg/dL.</li> </ul> <h3>What causes hypoglycemia?</h3> <p>Hypoglycemia is common in people who have <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/diabetestype1.html\">diabetes type 1</a> or who have <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/diabetestype2.html\">diabetes type 2</a> and take insulin or other <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/diabetesmedicines.html\">diabetes medicines</a>. It can happen:</p> <ul> <li>As a side effect of insulin or some other medicines that help your pancreas release insulin into your blood. These medicines can lower your blood glucose level.</li> <li>If you don't eat or drink enough <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/carbohydrates.html\">carbohydrates</a> (carbs). Carbs are the main source of glucose for your body.</li> <li>If you get a lot more physical activity than usual.</li> <li>If you drink too much alcohol without enough food.</li> <li>When you are sick and can't eat enough food or keep food down.</li> </ul> <p>Although it's rare, you can still get low blood glucose without having diabetes. The causes can include conditions such as <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/liverdiseases.html\">liver disease</a>, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/kidneydiseases.html\">kidney disease</a>, and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/hormones.html\">hormone</a> deficiencies (lack of certain hormones). It can also happen in people who have had certain types of <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/weightlosssurgery.html\">weight loss surgery</a>. Some medicines, such as certain heart medicines and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/antibiotics.html\">antibiotics</a>, can also cause it. See your health care provider to find out the cause of your low blood glucose and how to treat it.</p> <h3>What are the symptoms of hypoglycemia?</h3> <p>The symptoms of low blood glucose tend to come on quickly. The symptoms can be different for everyone, but they may include:</p> <ul> <li>Shaking</li> <li>Sweating</li> <li>Nervousness or anxiety</li> <li>Irritability or confusion</li> <li><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/dizzinessandvertigo.html\">Dizziness</a></li> <li>Hunger</li> </ul> <h3>How is hypoglycemia diagnosed?</h3> <p>If you have diabetes, you'll most likely need to check your blood glucose every day and make sure that it's not too low. You can do this with a blood glucose meter or continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system.</p> <p>There are also <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/blood-glucose-test/\">blood tests</a> that providers can use to check if your blood glucose is too low.</p> <p>If you don't have diabetes and you have hypoglycemia, your provider will likely order other tests to try to figure out the cause.</p> <h3>What are the treatments for hypoglycemia?</h3> <p>If you have mild or moderate hypoglycemia, eating or drinking something with carbohydrates can help. But severe hypoglycemia can cause serious complications, including passing out, coma, or even death. Severe hypoglycemia can be treated with glucagon, a hormone that raises blood glucose levels. It can be given as nasal spray or injection. If you have diabetes, your provider can prescribe you a glucagon kit for use in case of an emergency.</p> <p>If you have diabetes and you often have mild or moderate low blood glucose, your health care team may make changes to your <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/diabeticdiet.html\">diabetes meal plan</a>, physical activity plan, and/or diabetes medicines.</p> <p>If you don't have diabetes and you keep having low blood glucose, the treatment will depend on what is causing it to happen.</p> <h3>Can hypoglycemia be prevented?</h3> <p>If you have diabetes and you take insulin or other medicines that lower blood glucose, you can help prevent hypoglycemia if you:</p> <ul> <li>Follow your diabetes meal plan. Eat and drink enough carbs to keep your blood glucose in your target range. Also carry a source of fast-acting carbohydrate, such as glucose tablets or a juice box, with you in case your blood glucose gets too low.</li> <li>Be safe during physical activity. Check your blood glucose before and afterwards. You may need to eat a snack before your physical activity.</li> <li>If you take diabetes medicines, make sure to take them correctly.</li> </ul>",

One of the key processes in which human body eliminates toxic chemicals as well as hormones (such as estrogen) is by glucuronidation. When beta-glucuronidase deconjugates these glucuronides, it prolongs the stay of the hormone or toxic chemical in the body. Elevated beta-glucuronidase activity has been implicated to be associated with an increased risk for hormone-dependent cancers like breast, prostate, and colon cancers. Thereby, aceglatone may suppress the developments of hormone-dependent cancers mediated through beta-glucuronidase inhibition.",

The reduction in hepatic production of apoC-III results in subsequent reduction of serum levels of very-low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C).

Generalized itching, hives, muscle pains, arthralgias, fatigue, and adult worms visibly migrating under the surface of the skin may be observed. Severe complications such as encephalopathy have been reported in highly infected individuals receiving ivermectin during mass drug administration programs for the control of onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis (see these terms).",

Propylthiouracil (PTU) interferes with the oxidation of iodine possibly by interaction with peroxidase or a peroxidase-mediated complex reaction, thereby inhibiting synthesis of thyroid hormones tri-iodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4). In addition, this agent inhibits the Type I 5'-deiodinase (D1), an enzyme involved in the peripheral conversion of thyroxine to tri-iodothyronine. This results in decreased plasma triodothyronine concentrations and decreased entrance of thyroxine into cells thereby reducing thyroid hormone activity.

It causes extreme, sudden burning or shock-like pain. It usually affects one side of the face. Any vibration on your face, even from talking, can set it off. The condition may come and go, disappearing for days or even months. But the longer you have it, the less often it goes away.</p> <p>TN usually affects people over 50, especially women. The cause is probably a blood vessel pressing on the trigeminal nerve, one of the largest nerves in the head. Tumors and multiple sclerosis can also cause TN, but in some cases the cause is unknown.</p> <p>There is no specific test for TN. It can be hard to diagnose, since many other conditions can cause facial pain.

Although the mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated, thiabendazole inhibits the helminth-specific mitochondrial enzyme fumarate reductase, thereby inhibiting the citric acid cycle, mitochondrial respiration and subsequent production of ATP, ultimately leading to helminth's death. In addition, it has been suggested that thiabendazole may lead to inhibition of microtubule polymerization by binding to beta-tubulin and has an overt ovicidal effect with regard to some trichostrongylids.

This prevents the release of arachidonic acid, a precursor to prostaglandins and leukotrienes, both important mediators in the pro-inflammatory response mechanism. In addition, this agent exerts its mineralocorticoid effect on the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the kidney by inducing permease, an enzyme that regulates Na+ permeability in cells, thereby enhancing Na+ reabsorption and water retention as well as increasing K+, H+ excretion.",

For example, the birth of a sibling, a divorce, or a death in the family may cause a child to act out. Behavior disorders are more serious. They involve a pattern of hostile, aggressive, or disruptive behaviors for more than 6 months. The behavior is also not appropriate for the child's age.</p> <p>Warning signs can include:</p><ul> <li>Harming or threatening themselves, other people or pets</li> <li>Damaging or destroying property </li> <li>Lying or stealing </li> <li>Not doing well in school, skipping school </li> <li>Early smoking, drinking or drug use </li> <li>Early sexual activity </li> <li>Frequent tantrums and arguments </li> <li>Consistent hostility toward authority figures </li> </ul> <p> If you see signs of a problem, ask for help. Poor choices can become habits. Kids who have behavior problems are at higher risk for school failure, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/childmentalhealth.html\">mental health problems</a>, and even <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/suicide.html\">suicide</a>. Classes or family therapy may help parents learn to set and enforce limits. Talk therapy and behavior therapy for your child can also help.</p>",

Timolol competitively binds to beta-1-adrenergic receptors in the heart and vascular smooth muscle and beta-2-receptors in the bronchial and vascular smooth muscle, resulting in a decrease in beta-adrenergic stimulation. Beta-1-receptor blockade results in a decrease in resting and exercise heart rate and cardiac output, a decrease in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and, possibly, a reduction in reflex orthostatic hypotension. Beta-2-blockade results in an increase in peripheral vascular resistance. The ultimate results include vasodilation, and negative chronotropic and inotropic cardiac effects. In addition, timolol reduces intra-ocular pressure possibly by decreasing aqueous humor production by reduction of blood flow to the ciliary processes and cAMP synthesis.",

        "definition": "<h3>What is fatigue?</h3> <p>Fatigue is a feeling of weariness, tiredness, or lack of energy. It can interfere with your usual daily activities. Fatigue can be a normal response to physical activity, emotional <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/stress.html\">stress</a>, boredom, or lack of sleep. But sometimes it can be a sign of a mental or physical condition. If you have been feeling tired for weeks, contact your health care provider. They can help you find out what's causing your fatigue and recommend ways to relieve it.</p> <h3>What causes fatigue?</h3> <p>Fatigue itself is not a disease; it's a symptom. It can have many different causes, including <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/pregnancy.html\">pregnancy</a> and various medical problems, treatments, and lifestyle habits such as:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Medical problems:</strong> <ul> <li>Chronic (long-lasting) diseases such as <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/diabetes.html\">diabetes</a>, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/copd.html\">COPD</a> (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/heartdiseases.html\">heart</a>, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/liverdiseases.html\">liver</a>, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/kidneydiseases.html\">kidney</a> and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/thyroiddiseases.html\">thyroid</a> diseases</li> <li>Untreated <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/chronicpain.html\">pain</a> and diseases like <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/fibromyalgia.html\">fibromyalgia</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/anemia.html\">Anemia</a></li> <li>Infections</li> <li><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/parkinsonsdisease.html\">Parkinson's disease</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/sleepapnea.html\">Sleep apnea</a> and other <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/sleepdisorders.html\">sleep disorders</a></li> <li>Recent <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/stroke.html\">stroke</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/mentaldisorders.html\">Mental disorders</a> such as <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/depression.html\">depression</a> and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/anxiety.html\">anxiety</a></li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Treatments:</strong> <ul> <li>Cancer treatments such as <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/cancerchemotherapy.html\">chemotherapy</a>, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/radiationtherapy.html\">radiation</a>, and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/bonemarrowtransplantation.html\">bone marrow transplants</a></li> <li>Recovering from major surgery</li> <li>Taking certain medicines, such as <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/antidepressants.html\">antidepressants</a>, antihistamines, and medicines for nausea and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/painrelievers.html\">pain</a></li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Lifestyle habits:</strong> <ul> <li>Not getting enough sleep</li> <li>Staying up too late</li> <li>Drinking too much <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/alcohol.html\">alcohol</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/druguseandaddiction.html\">Substance use</a></li> <li>Having too much <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/caffeine.html\">caffeine</a> (which can keep you from getting a good night's sleep)</li> <li>Getting too little or too much exercise</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Overwhelming fatigue is part of a disorder called <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/myalgicencephalomyelitischronicfatiguesyndrome.html\">myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome</a> (ME/CFS). The fatigue caused by this disorder is different from a tired feeling that goes away after you rest. Instead, the fatigue in ME/CFS lasts a long time, does not get better with rest, and limits your ability to do ordinary daily activities.</p> <h3>What can I do to manage fatigue?</h3> <p>If you've had fatigue that does not get better after several weeks, call your provider. They will ask questions about your sleep, daily activities, appetite, and exercise. They will likely do a physical exam and order lab tests. Once they decide on a diagnosis, they can tell you what treatments might help.</p> <p>You can also make some lifestyle changes to feel less tired:</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/howmuchexercisedoineed.html\">Get regular physical activity</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/healthysleep.html\">Improve your sleep habits</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/quittingsmoking.html\">Stop smoking</a> (if you smoke), since smoking is linked to many diseases that can cause fatigue</li> <li>Manage stress</li> <li>Eat a healthy diet and avoid alcohol</li> </ul> <p>It also may be helpful for you to keep a fatigue diary. This can help you find patterns throughout the day, such as when you feel more tired and when you have more energy. It can also help you plan for activities that may give you more energy.</p> <p class=\"\">NIH: National Institute on Aging</p>",

Cephalexin binds to and inactivates penicillin-binding proteins (PBP) located on the inner membrane of the bacterial cell wall.

This results in the weakening of the bacterial cell wall and causes cell lysis. Compared to second and third generation cephalosporins, cephalexin is more active against gram-positive and less active against gram-negative organisms.

These carboplatin-induced DNA and protein effects result in apoptosis and cell growth inhibition. This agent possesses tumoricidal activity similar to that of its parent compound, cisplatin, but is more stable and less toxic.

Ethinyl estradiol binds to the estrogen receptor complex and enters the nucleus, activating DNA transcription of genes involved in estrogenic cellular responses. This agent also inhibits 5-alpha reductase in epididymal tissue, which lowers testosterone levels and may delay progression of prostatic cancer. In addition to its antineoplastic effects, ethinyl estradiol protects against osteoporosis. In animal models, short-term therapy with this agent has been shown to provide long-term protection against breast cancer, mimicking the antitumor effects of pregnancy.

Diethylpropion stimulates neurons to release and maintain high levels of catecholamines including dopamine and norepinephrine resulting in a suppression of hunger signals and appetite. This agent may also indirectly affect leptin-neuropeptide Y (NPY) neurotransmission, which exerts control on metabolic processes such as food intake and body weight homeostasis. Via elevated catecholamine, diethylpropion indirectly elevates leptin levels in the brain, which in turn inhibits production of NPY, a potent stimulator of feeding behavior, thereby preventing the initiation of eating, increasing energy expenditure, and decreasing fat storage.",

Some people who have psoriasis also get a form of arthritis called <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/psoriaticarthritis.html\">psoriatic arthritis</a>.</p> <p>A problem with your immune system causes psoriasis. In a process called cell turnover, skin cells that grow deep in your skin rise to the surface. Normally, this takes a month. In psoriasis, it happens in just days because your cells rise too fast. </p> <p>Psoriasis can be hard to diagnose because it can look like other skin diseases. Your doctor might need to look at a small skin sample under a microscope.</p> <p>Psoriasis can last a long time, even a lifetime. Symptoms come and go. Things that make them worse include:</p><ul> <li>Infections</li> <li>Stress</li> <li>Dry skin</li> <li>Certain medicines</li> </ul> <p>Psoriasis usually occurs in adults.

In addition, glycopyrrolate inhibits the release of gastric, pharyngeal, tracheal, and bronchial secretions.

        "definition": "<h3>What is urinary incontinence (UI)?</h3> <p>Urinary incontinence (UI) is the loss of bladder control, or being unable to control urination. It is a common condition. It can range from being a minor problem to something that greatly affects your daily life. In any case, it can get better with proper treatment.</p> <h3>What are the types of urinary incontinence (UI)?</h3> <p>There are several different types of UI. Each type has different symptoms and causes:</p><ul> <li><strong>Stress incontinence</strong> happens when stress or pressure on your bladder causes you to leak urine. This could be due to coughing, sneezing, laughing, lifting something heavy, or physical activity. Causes include <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/pelvicfloordisorders.html\">weak pelvic floor muscles</a> and the bladder being out of its normal position.</li> <li><strong>Urge, or urgency, incontinence</strong> happens when you have a strong urge (need) to urinate, and some urine leaks out before you can make it to the toilet. It is often related to an <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/overactivebladder.html\">overactive bladder</a>. Urge incontinence is most common in older people. It can sometimes be a sign of a <a href=\"urinarytractinfections.html\" tid=\"448\">urinary tract infection (UTI)</a>. It can also happen in some <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/neurologicdiseases.html\">neurological conditions</a>, such as <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/multiplesclerosis.html\">multiple sclerosis</a> and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/spinalcordinjuries.html\">spinal cord injuries</a>.</li> <li><strong>Overflow incontinence</strong> happens when your bladder doesn't empty all the way. This causes too much urine to stay in your bladder. Your bladder gets too full, and you leak urine. This form of UI is most common in men. Some of the causes include tumors, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/kidneystones.html\">kidney stones</a>, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/diabetes.html\">diabetes</a>, and certain medicines.</li> <li><strong>Functional incontinence</strong> happens when a physical or mental <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/disabilities.html\">disability</a>, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/speechandcommunicationdisorders.html\">trouble speaking</a>, or some other problem keeps you from getting to the toilet in time. For example, someone with arthritis may have trouble unbuttoning his or her pants, or a person with <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/alzheimersdisease.html\">Alzheimer's disease</a> may not realize they need to plan to use the toilet.</li> <li><strong>Mixed incontinence</strong> means that you have more than one type of incontinence. It's usually a combination of stress and urge incontinence.</li> <li><strong>Transient incontinence</strong> is urine leakage that is caused by a temporary (transient) situation such as an infection or new medicine. Once the cause is removed, the incontinence goes away.</li> <li><strong>Bedwetting</strong> refers to urine leakage during sleep. This is most common in children, but adults can also have it. <ul> <li>Bedwetting is normal for many children. It is more common in boys. Bedwetting is often not considered a health problem, especially when it runs in the family. But if it still happens often at age 5 and older, it may be because of a bladder control problem. This problem could be caused by slow physical development, an illness, making too much urine at night, or another problem. Sometimes there is more than one cause.</li> <li>In adults, the causes include some medicines, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/caffeine.html\">caffeine</a>, and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/alcohol.html\">alcohol</a>. It can also be caused by certain health problems, such as <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/diabetesinsipidus.html\">diabetes insipidus</a>, a urinary tract infection (UTI), kidney stones, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/enlargedprostatebph.html\">enlarged prostate</a> (BPH), and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/sleepapnea.html\">sleep apnea</a>.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h3>Who is at risk for urinary incontinence (UI)?</h3> <p>In adults, you are at higher risk of developing UI if you:</p><ul> <li>Are female, especially after going through pregnancy, childbirth, and/or menopause</li> <li>Are older. As you age, your urinary tract muscles weaken, making it harder to hold in urine.</li> <li>Are a man with <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/prostatediseases.html\">prostate problems</a></li> <li>Have certain health problems, such as diabetes, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/obesity.html\">obesity</a>, or long-lasting <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/constipation.html\">constipation</a></li> <li>Are a smoker</li> <li>Have a <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/birthdefects.html\">birth defect</a> that affects the structure of your urinary tract</li> </ul> <p>In children, bedwetting is more common in younger children, boys, and those whose parents wet the bed when they were children.</p> <h3>How is urinary incontinence (UI) diagnosed?</h3> <p>Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:</p><ul> <li>A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms. Your provider may ask you to keep a bladder diary for a few days before your appointment. The bladder diary includes how much and when you drink liquids, when and how much you urinate, and whether you leak urine.</li> <li>A physical exam, which can include a rectal exam. Women may also get a pelvic exam.</li> <li><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/urinalysis.html\">Urine</a> and/or blood tests</li> <li>Bladder function tests</li> <li><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/diagnosticimaging.html\">Imaging tests</a></li> </ul> <h3>What are the treatments for urinary incontinence (UI)?</h3> <p>Treatment depends on the type and cause of your UI. You may need a combination of treatments. Your provider may first suggest self-care treatments, including:</p><ul> <li><strong>Lifestyle changes</strong> to reduce leaks: <ul> <li>Drinking the right amount of liquid at the right time</li> <li>Being physically active</li> <li>Staying at a healthy weigh</li> <li>Avoiding constipation</li> <li>Not smoking</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Bladder training.</strong> This involves urinating according to a schedule. Your provider makes a schedule from you, based on information from your bladder diary. After you adjust to the schedule, you gradually wait a little longer between trips to the bathroom. This can help stretch your bladder so it can hold more urine.</li> <li><strong>Doing exercises to strengthen your pelvic floor muscles</strong>. Strong pelvic floor muscles hold in urine better than weak muscles. The strengthening exercises are called Kegel exercises. They involve tightening and relaxing the muscles that control urine flow.</li> </ul> <p>If these treatments do not work, your provider may suggest other options such as:</p><ul> <li><strong>Medicines</strong>, which can be used to <ul> <li>Relax the bladder muscles, to help prevent bladder spasms</li> <li>Block nerve signals that cause urinary frequency and urgency</li> <li>In men, shrink the prostate and improve urine flow</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Medical devices</strong>, including <ul> <li>A catheter, which is a tube to carry urine out of the body. You might use one a few times a day or all the time.</li> <li>For women, a ring or a tampon-like device inserted into the vagina. The devices pushes up against your urethra to help decrease leaks.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Bulking agents</strong>, which are injected into the bladder neck and urethra tissues to thicken them. This helps close your bladder opening so you have less leaking.</li> <li><strong>Electrical nerve stimulation</strong>, which involves changing your bladder's reflexes using pulses of electricity</li> <li><strong>Surgery</strong> to support the bladder in its normal position. This may be done with a sling that is attached to the pubic bone.</li> </ul> <p class=\"\">NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</p>",

        "definition": "<h3>What is tuberculosis (TB)?</h3> <p>Tuberculosis (TB) is a <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/bacterialinfections.html\">bacterial disease</a> that usually attacks the lungs. But it can also attack other parts of the body, including the kidneys, spine, and brain.</p> <p>Not everyone infected with TB bacteria (germs) becomes sick. So, there are two types of TB conditions:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Inactive (latent) TB infection</strong>, where the TB germs live in your body but don't make you sick.</li> <li><strong>TB disease (active TB)</strong> where you get sick from the TB germs. TB disease can almost always be cured with <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/antibiotics.html\">antibiotics</a>. But if it's not treated properly, it can be fatal.</li> </ul> <p>TB is found in the U.S., but it is more common in certain other countries.</p> <h3>What causes tuberculosis (TB)?</h3> <p>TB is caused by bacteria (germs) called <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>. The germs spread from person to person through the air. People who have TB disease in their throat or lungs spread the germs in the air when they cough, sneeze, talk, or sing. If you breathe in the air that has the germs, you can get TB.</p> <p>TB is not spread by touching, kissing, or sharing food or dishes.</p> <p>You're more likely to catch TB from people you live or work with than from people you see for shorter amounts of time.</p> <h3>Who is more likely to get infected with tuberculosis (TB) germs?</h3> <p>Anyone who is near a person with TB disease can get infected with the germs. You are more likely to be near someone with TB disease if you:</p> <ul> <li>Were born in or often travel to countries where TB disease is common</li> <li>Are a health care worker</li> <li>Work or live in a place where TB is more common, such as shelters for people without homes, jails, and nursing homes</li> </ul> <h3>Who is more likely to develop TB disease?</h3> <p>Certain people are more likely to get sick with TB disease after they get infected. They include people who:</p> <ul> <li>Have <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/hiv.html\">HIV</a></li> <li>Became infected with TB in the last 2 years</li> <li>Have other diseases, such as <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/diabetes.html\">diabetes</a>, that make it hard for your body to fight TB germs</li> <li>Have <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/alcoholusedisorderaud.html\">alcohol use disorder</a> (AUD) or inject <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/druguseandaddiction.html\">illegal drugs</a></li> <li>Were not treated correctly for TB in the past</li> <li>Are under age 5</li> <li>Are an older adult</li> <li>Take medicines that <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/immunesystemanddisorders.html\">weaken the immune system</a>, such as medicines taken after an <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/organtransplantation.html\">organ transplant</a>, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/steroids.html\">steroids</a>, and specialized treatments for certain <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/autoimmunediseases.html\">autoimmune diseases</a></li> </ul> <h3>What are the symptoms of tuberculosis (TB)?</h3> <p>Most people who have TB germs in their bodies don't get sick with TB disease. Instead, they have inactive TB infection. With an inactive TB infection, you:</p> <ul> <li>Don't have symptoms</li> <li>Can't spread TB to others</li> <li>Could get sick with active TB disease in the future if your immune system becomes weak for another reason</li> <li>Need to take medicine to prevent getting sick with active TB disease in the future</li> </ul> <p><strong>If you have TB disease</strong>, the TB germs are active, meaning that they are growing (multiplying) inside your body and making you sick. If the TB is growing in your lungs or throat, you can spread the TB germs to other people. You can get sick with TB disease weeks to years after you're infected with TB germs.</p> <p>With TB disease, your symptoms will depend on where the TB is growing in your body:</p> <ul> <li>General symptoms may include: <ul> <li>Chills and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/fever.html\">fever</a></li> <li>Night sweats (heavy sweating during sleep)</li> <li>Losing weight without trying</li> <li>Loss of appetite</li> <li>Weakness or <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/fatigue.html\">fatigue</a></li> </ul> </li> <li>Symptoms from TB disease in your lungs may include: <ul> <li>A <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/cough.html\">cough</a> that lasts longer than 3 weeks</li> <li>Coughing up blood or sputum (a thick mucus from the lungs)</li> <li><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/chestpain.html\">Chest pain</a></li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h3>How is tuberculosis (TB) diagnosed?</h3> <p>Your health care provider or your local health department can test you to find out if you have TB germs in your body. They will give you either a <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/tuberculosis-screening/\">TB skin or blood test</a>.</p> <p>If your test shows that you have TB germs, you'll need to have other tests to see if the germs are actively growing:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Tests for TB disease in the lungs</strong> usually include <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/acid-fast-bacillus-afb-tests/\">testing samples of your sputum</a> and having chest <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/xrays.html\">x-rays</a>.</li> <li><strong>Tests for TB disease in other parts of your body</strong> may include tests of <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/urinalysis.html\">urine</a> and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/biopsy.html\">tissue samples</a>.</li> </ul> <p>You may need a TB test if you have symptoms of TB disease or if you are at high risk because you are more likely to be near someone with TB disease.</p> <p>People who have HIV also need to get tested for TB. HIV weakens your immune system. So if you have both HIV and inactive TB, the TB can quickly become active TB disease. You will need treatment for the inactive TB as soon as possible to prevent active TB disease.</p> <h3>What is the treatment for tuberculosis (TB)?</h3> <p>The treatment for both inactive TB infection and TB disease is antibiotics. To make sure you get rid of all the TB germs in your body, it's very important to follow the directions for taking your medicine.</p> <p>If you don't follow the directions, the TB germs in your body could change and become <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/antibioticresistance.html\">antibiotic resistant</a>. That means the medicine may stop working and your TB may become hard to cure.</p> <ul> <li><strong>For inactive TB infections</strong>, you need to take medicines for three, four, six, or nine months, depending on the treatment plan. Treatment helps make sure you don't get TB disease in the future.</li> <li><strong>For active TB disease</strong>, you usually need to take medicines for four, six, or nine months, depending on the treatment plan. Treatment will almost always cure you if you take your pills the right way.</li> <li><strong>For TB disease in your lungs or throat</strong>, you'll need to stay home for a few weeks, so you don't spread disease to other people. You can protect the people you live with by: <ul> <li>Covering your nose and mouth.</li> <li>Opening windows when possible.</li> <li>Not getting too close to them.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>For drug-resistant TB disease,</strong> which means that the TB germs are resistant to certain TB medicines, you will need to take special medicines. Treatment may take a long time, sometimes months or years. The medicines can cause <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/drugreactions.html\">side effects</a>. Your provider will closely monitor your treatment to make sure the medicines are working.</li> </ul> <p>By following medical advice for TB testing and treatment, you can keep yourself healthy and help stop the spread of TB.</p> <p class=\"\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</p>",

        "definition": "<h3>What are autoimmune diseases?</h3> <p>Your <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/immunesystemanddisorders.html\">immune system</a> protects you from disease and infection by attacking germs that get into your body, such as viruses and bacteria. Your immune system can tell that the germs aren't part of you, so it destroys them. If you have an autoimmune disease, your immune system attacks the healthy cells of your organs and tissues by mistake.</p> <p>There are more than 80 types of autoimmune diseases. They can affect almost any part of your body. For example, alopecia areata is an autoimmune disease of the skin that causes hair loss. Autoimmune hepatitis affects the liver. In <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/diabetestype1.html\">type 1 diabetes</a>, the immune system attacks the pancreas. And in <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/rheumatoidarthritis.html\">rheumatoid arthritis</a>, the immune system can attack many parts of the body, including the joints, lungs, and eyes.</p> <h3>What causes autoimmune diseases?</h3> <p>No one is sure why autoimmune diseases happen. But you can't catch them from other people.</p> <p>Autoimmune diseases do tend to run in families, which means that certain genes may make some people more likely to develop a problem. Viruses, certain chemicals, and other things in the environment may trigger an autoimmune disease if you already have the genes for it.</p> <h3>Who is at risk for autoimmune diseases?</h3> <p>Millions of Americans of all ages have autoimmune diseases. Women develop many types of autoimmune diseases much more often than men. And if you have one autoimmune disease, you are more likely to get another.</p> <h3>What are the symptoms of autoimmune diseases?</h3> <p>The symptoms of an autoimmune disease depend on the part of your body that's affected. Many types of autoimmune diseases cause redness, swelling, heat, and pain, which are the signs and symptoms of inflammation. But other illnesses can cause the same symptoms.</p> <p>The symptoms of autoimmune diseases can come and go. During a flare-up, your symptoms may get severe for a while. Later on, you may have a remission, which means that your symptoms get better or disappear for a period of time.</p> <h3>How are autoimmune diseases diagnosed?</h3> <p>Doctors often have a hard time diagnosing autoimmune diseases. There's usually not a specific test to show whether you have a certain autoimmune disease. And the symptoms can be confusing. That's because many autoimmune diseases have similar symptoms. And some symptoms, such as muscle aches, are common in many other illnesses. So it can take a long time and some visits to different types of doctors to get a diagnosis.</p> <p>To help your doctor find out if an autoimmune disease is causing your symptoms,:</p><ul> <li>Learn about the health conditions in your <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/familyhistory.html\">family history</a>. What health problems did your grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins have? Write down what you learn and share it with your doctor.</li> <li>Keep track of your symptoms, including how long they last and what makes them better or worse. Share your notes with your doctor.</li> <li>See a specialist who deals with the symptoms that bother you most. For example, if you have rash, see a dermatologist (skin doctor).</li> </ul> <h3>What are the treatments for autoimmune diseases?</h3> <p>The treatment depends on the disease. In most cases, the goal of treatment is to suppress (slow down) your immune system, and ease swelling, redness, and pain from inflammation. Your doctor may give you <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/steroids.html\">corticosteroids</a> or other medicines to help you feel better. For some diseases, you may need treatment for the rest of your life.</p>",

Upon injection into the affected muscle, the heavy chain portion of onabotulinumtoxinA binds to the cell membrane of the motor nerve and is internalized via endocytosis. Upon entry, the light chain portion of the toxin is activated and cleaves the protein SNAP-25, thereby preventing the fusion of acetylcholine (ACh)-containing synaptic vesicles with the cell membrane and, so, the releaseof ACh into the neuromuscularjunction; subsequent binding of ACH to motor end-plate nicotinic acid receptors and ACh-mediated muscle contraction are thus blocked. In addition to ACh, onabotulinumtoxinA may inhibit the release of neuropeptides, such as substance P and glutamate, which may contribute to its analgesic activity.

Ramipril is converted in the liver by de-esterification into its active form ramiprilat, which inhibits ACE, thereby blocking the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. This abolishes the potent vasoconstrictive actions of angiotensin II and leads to vasodilatation. This agent also causes an increase in bradykinin levels and a decrease in angiotensin II-induced aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex, thereby promoting diuresis and natriuresis.
